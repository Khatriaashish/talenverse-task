## Addition
Additionally, I have made this frontend powered by backend. I have included:
+ Dynamical rendering of team member at team section
+ Dynamical rendering of FAQs
+ Working login and signup (admin account provided access to CMS, however client login dont have any privileges for now) (email at khatriaashish1@gmail.com for admin credentials for testing)
+ Messages from contact form stored in database and user will be notified about `Query Received` through provided email
+ Powerful CMS for managing team profile, FAQs, and messages from contact page.

## Other features
